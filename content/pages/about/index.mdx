I am passionate about finding sustainable solutions to a variety of problems afflicting low-income households. I also advise impact enterprises, start-ups on building business models and identifying new sources of revenue, and growth strategies.

Some of the organisations I have been associated/working with are Nova India, Olam International, IFMR Research, the World Bank, GIZ, Dharma Life, Tata Trusts, Intellecap etc. In my spare time, I love to read and tinker with my gadgets.
